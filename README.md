bash_crc16
==========

This is an implementation of the CRC 16 algorithm in Bash. I only needed CRC 16 for my purposes, but this can be made more generic and expanded to handle any value from 1-64.

I converted the algorithm from the javascript implementation found at: http://www.zorc.breitbandkatze.de/crc.html

I doubt this is the most optimal implementation, and if you happen to know of a way to optimise this more, I would love to hear how, or see a patch.

Thanks :)
